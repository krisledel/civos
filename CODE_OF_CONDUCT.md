# CivOS Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We further recognize and embrace the unique nature of the CivOS project, which explicitly seeks to create space for diverse epistemic frameworks and knowledge systems. We therefore extend our pledge to respect and value different ways of knowing, understanding, and validating information.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints, knowledge systems, and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Engaging with ideas from unfamiliar knowledge systems with an open mind
* Acknowledging the limitations and situatedness of one's own knowledge

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Dismissing or devaluing entire knowledge systems or epistemological frameworks
* Asserting the superiority of particular ways of knowing without engagement
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Epistemic Pluralism

As a project centered on epistemic coordination, CivOS is committed to creating space for multiple knowledge systems to interact productively. We recognize that:

* Different communities have developed valid approaches to generating and validating knowledge
* No single epistemic framework is universally applicable across all contexts
* Knowledge is always situated within specific cultural, historical, and environmental contexts
* Diverse perspectives strengthen our collective ability to make sense of complex phenomena
* Epistemic justice requires active efforts to counterbalance historical power imbalances

We therefore expect community members to approach epistemic differences with humility, curiosity, and respect.

## Responsibilities of Maintainers and Project Leaders

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Further, maintainers commit to modeling epistemic humility and pluralism in their own interactions, and to ensuring that project governance structures do not inadvertently privilege particular knowledge systems.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at conduct@civos.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Conflict Resolution Process

When conflicts arise, especially those related to epistemic differences, we encourage community members to:

1. **Seek understanding first**: Ask clarifying questions to better understand the other perspective before responding
2. **Identify shared goals**: Focus on the common objectives that bring us together
3. **Recognize power dynamics**: Be mindful of historical and contextual power imbalances that may influence the interaction
4. **Use structured dialogue**: Consider frameworks like Bohm Dialogue or structured debate formats when discussing challenging topics
5. **Involve facilitation when needed**: Request support from community facilitators for complex disagreements

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html

The section on Epistemic Pluralism has been added specifically for the CivOS project to reflect its unique focus on epistemic coordination.
