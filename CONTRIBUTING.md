## Project Philosophy

CivOS is built on the recognition that we face fundamental epistemic challenges in our information environment. Our goal is to create practical tools and frameworks that enhance coordination across different knowledge systems, improve information provenance and trust, and rebuild our collective sense-making capabilities.

Our approach is characterized by:

- **Epistemic Pluralism**: We value diverse ways of knowing and aim to create systems that allow multiple knowledge frameworks to interact productively.
- **Practical Implementation**: We balance philosophical depth with concrete, implementable solutions.
- **Distributed Coordination**: We favor approaches that distribute agency and avoid single points of failure.
- **Empirical Validation**: We test our ideas through real-world implementations and adapt based on evidence.
- **Reflexive Design**: We apply the principles of recursivity and self-examination to our own development process.

### For Domain Experts

- Contribute use cases from your field of expertise
- Help translate CivOS concepts to specific domains
- Provide feedback on implementations in your domain
- Connect the project with relevant stakeholders and communities

### For Researchers

- Help strengthen the theoretical foundations
- Document relevant research and evidence
- Design experiments and evaluation frameworks
- Contribute to publications and knowledge dissemination

### For Everyone

- Test implementations and provide feedback
- Improve documentation and translations

## Development Process

### Getting Started

1. **Familiarize yourself with the project**:
   - Read the [Philosophical Basis](../docs/philosophical-basis.md)
   - Review the [Technical Overview](../docs/technical-overview.md)
   - Explore the [examples](../examples)

2. **Set up your development environment**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/civos-initiative/civos.git
   cd civos
   npm install  # or equivalent for your component
   ```

3. **Find an issue to work on**:
   - Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`
   - Introduce yourself in the issue comments before starting work
   - Ask questions if anything is unclear

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** to your own account
2. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes** following our code standards
4. **Write tests** for new functionality
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages
7. **Submit a pull request** referencing any related issues

### Review Process

All contributions go through a review process:

1. **Automated checks** will verify formatting, tests, etc.
2. **Peer review** by at least one other contributor
3. **Maintainer approval** before merging
4. **Integration testing** for larger changes

We aim to review pull requests within 1-2 weeks. Please be patient and responsive to feedback.

## Code and Documentation Standards

### Code Standards

- Follow language-specific style guides:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/)
  - Python: [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Write clear comments for complex logic
- Include appropriate error handling
- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure accessibility compliance where relevant

### Documentation Standards

- Write in clear, accessible English
- Use inclusive language
- Include examples where possible
- Follow [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) for Markdown
- Keep technical and conceptual documentation separate

### Commit Message Format

We follow a simplified version of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): short summary

Detailed explanation if needed
```

Types include: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Example: `feat(trust): implement basic reputation calculation`

## Communication Channels

- **Issues**: Use GitHub issues for bug reports, feature requests, and specific tasks
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for broader topics and questions
- **Discord**: Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/civos-commons) for real-time chat
- **Forum**: Participate in longer discussions on our [forum](https://discuss.civos.org)
- **Meetings**: Attend our monthly community calls (announced on Discord)

## Governance Model

CivOS follows a polycentric governance model that reflects our philosophical foundations:

- **Core Team**: Responsible for overall project direction and major decisions
- **Working Groups**: Focus on specific aspects (e.g., Trust Systems, Knowledge Mapping)
- **Contributors**: Anyone who participates in the project
- **Community Council**: Elected representatives who provide oversight and conflict resolution

Decisions are made through a combination of consensus-seeking and, when necessary, voting. Our [Governance Document](../community/GOVERNANCE.md) provides more details.

## Epistemic Practices

As a project centered on epistemics, we encourage contributors to:

- **Explicitly state assumptions** in proposals and designs
- **Provide reasoning and evidence** for claims when possible
- **Acknowledge limitations** of approaches and implementations
- **Document alternative viewpoints** when disagreements arise
- **Reflect on the epistemic implications** of technical choices

## Recognition and Attribution

We believe in recognizing all forms of contribution. Beyond commits, we track:

- Documentation improvements
- Issue reporting and refinement
- Community support and mentoring
- Testing and feedback
- Concept development

See our [Contributors page](https://civos.org/contributors) for acknowledgment of these diverse contributions.
