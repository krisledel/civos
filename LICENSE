## Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and the public can rely upon. The following considerations for the public also apply to creators and the public should follow them in order to make use of the licensed material.

1. **Public License Considerations**: Creative Commons public licenses are intended for use by the public. These licenses are widely and publicly available online. The licenses may also be obtained via CC directly. Where available, we prefer you use the hyperlinked licenses over alternatives.

2. **Understanding the license**: Our licenses are designed to be legally binding and enable use of the licensed material without additional permission. Please review the license terms and conditions, including the jurisdiction selected by the licensor. Keep in mind that your use must comply with the terms of the specific license—be careful, as not all of CC's licenses are the same. If you need permission beyond what the license allows, you may have to contact the licensor.

3. **Considerations for licensors**: Creative Commons public licenses are designed for use by the public, and by authors, creators, and others ("Licensors") who wish to offer original material to the public on the generous terms provided by these licenses. These licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. By applying a CC license, the licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under the specified terms and conditions. If material's license doesn't meet your needs, consider not using it or requesting permission from the author directly.

4. **Considerations for the public**: When a licensor chooses a Creative Commons license, they are saying the public can use that material under the license terms (such as making derivatives, commercial use, etc.). If you wish to use the material in a manner not permitted by the license, don't use the material or contact the licensor for permission.

Creative Commons licenses, with the exception of the CC0 Public Domain Dedication, provide the following core elements:

- **Attribution** – You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
- **ShareAlike** – If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
